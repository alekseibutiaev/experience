Example of using together autotools and Kbuilb -kernel build system-
With autotools you can build your user space program and with Kbuild system you can build you kernel module.

0.- LETS START

Just tar -xzvf helloWorldAutotoolsKbuild.tgz

cd helloWorldAutotoolsKbuild
autoreconf --install
./configure
make

Â¡your are done!

now try

cd cProgram
./cProgram

or

cd sourceModule
insmod linuxKernelModule



Of course , your kernel must be configured to be able to compile the module and you must have autotools ... and a C compiler ,-)

enjoy and i hope it helps.

1.- INTRO

This little Hello World shows how to use together autotools and Kbuild system, this is something that some people find when develop user space -daemons, ...-  and kernel modules at the same time in the same proyect and need to glue it easilly.

2.- HOW DOES IT WORKS?

Well you must have at least some idea of what make, autotools and kbuild is to understand how it works.
But it just do the autotools stuff for the user space program and just link to the Kbuild system to build the kernel module.

2.1.- configure.ac

Must have and entry for the user space c code but it doesn't for the kernel module, because the Kbuild system do the work.

2.2.- Makefile.am -top level-

Must include the reference to the user space and kernel module.

2.3.- Kbuild

It's a simple Kbuild file with the simple , by hand, Makefile. Both are really easy thanks to Linus and folks.

2.4.- Makefile.am -user space program level-.

It's a simple Makefile.am with the reference to the main.c source.
